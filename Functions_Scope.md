# Functions

## Syntax

Are there any rules about where the function has to be placed in your code file so that it can run
(i.e., before main, after main, in the same file, in the same folder, etc)?

## Recursion

## Parameters

multiple parameters? Can they be of different data types?

## Returning

Can functions in your language return multiple values at the same time?

# Variabe Scope

## Loops

Declare a variable (say, x) in the main body of your program. Then declare a variable of the
same name inside of a loop. Is there a conflict? Is the old variable overwritten, or do you now
have two variables of the same name?

## Functions

## Global Variables

## Passing by Value/Reference

(Hint: write a function that alters its input, but doesn't return it. Pass it a variable, and see if
the alteration is visible in main after you call the function)

If you run this code (or the equivalent) in your language, what is the output? What does that tell
you about how the language handles assignments?
char [] a = {'c','a','t'}
char [] b = {'d','o','g'}
a=b
b[1] = 'u'
print a
print b
