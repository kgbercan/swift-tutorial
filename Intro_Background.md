# Swift
Swift is a general-purpose programming language--it is protocol-oriented, object-oriented, functional, imperative, and block structured. Swift is compiled.

Apple, Inc created Swift for iOS, OS X, watchOS, and tvOS app development. It builds and aims to replace C and Objective-C, which was previously and is still used for Apple-product app development, and it's backed by the Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks.
