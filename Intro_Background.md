# Swift

Chris Lattner of Apple, Inc created Swift for iOS, OS X, watchOS, and tvOS app development. Apple revealed the language in June of 2014 and realeased version 1.0 September 9th, 2014; the most recent version is . It is a general-purpose programming language--it is protocol-oriented, object-oriented, functional, imperative, and block structured.  Swift is backed by the Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks, and it's built on and aims to replace C and Objective-C, which was previously and is still used for Apple-product app development. Swift's more-standard syntax than Objective-C's out-dated syntax is intended to make the new language easier to use.
