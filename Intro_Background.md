# Swift

Swift is a general-purpose, high-level programming language used to write applications for Apple products. It is protocol-oriented, object-oriented, functional, imperative, and block structured. Swift is compiled and does not use a virtual machine.

As Swift is open-source, there are versions in development available for [download] (https://swift.org/download/#latest-development-snapshots), but the only version of Swift that can be used to write apps submitted to the App Store is the release that comes with Xcode, Swift 2.

# History

Chris Lattner of Apple, Inc. created Swift for iOS, OS X, watchOS, and tvOS app development. Apple revealed the language in June of 2014 and released version 1.0 September 9th, 2014. Prior to this release, Objective-C was the primary language used to write applications for Apple products. Swift is built on Objective-C and can be used alongside it but aims to replace the older language in Apple product app development.

Swift is intended to be easier to use than Objective-C, as Swift features syntax that is more standard than Objective-C's out-dated syntax. Additionally, it was designed to handle memory more predictably and safer than the older language; for example, the Swift.org website points out that unlike C-languages, Swift requires you to initialize variables before using them. Additionally, Swift checks arrays and integers for overflow and manages memory to prevent unexpected behavior.

# Usage

The Swift projects with the most stars on GitHub are:

1. Alamofire: https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire
2. SwiftJSON: https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON
3. SwiftGuide: https://github.com/ipader/SwiftGuide

# Resources

As I research and learn Swift over the next few months, I plan to use the [Swift 2.1 Language Guide from the iOS Developer Library] (https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID309) and the [iOS Developer Library] in general (https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/navigation/#section=Topics&topic=Swift).

If needed, I may make use of StackOverflow, but carefully, as not all suggestions are the best solutions.
