# Installation
Swift is typically installed by downloading the appropriate programming environment; you don't need to download Swift seperately from an IDE. If you would like to use a version of Swift that is in the works (and that possibly has some bugs), you will need to download it from the [Swift.org download page] (https://swift.org/download/#latest-development-snapshots).

You may notice that Swift.org only gives instructions for downloading to OS X and Linux. Apple does not have IDEs for any other operating systems, so if you do not have a Mac or Linux machine, you may not be able to code in Swift.

**On a related note, I am using a Mac and therefore will be using Xcode for all my Swift needs.** While I do point out some alternatives to writing with Swift on Mac below, after this section, I will write only from the point of view of an Xcode user.

## Installing on an OS X Machine
The IDE for Swift on a Mac is Xcode. To download Xcode, simply open the App Store on your Mac, search for Xcode, and download it for free.

Note that Swift.org features instructions for [getting Swift on Apple platforms] (https://swift.org/download/#apple-platforms), but that these instructions **only apply to those who want to try a version of Swift that is not officially released.** If you want to use the most current version of Swift backed by Apple, just download Xcode as I've described above.

## Installing on a Linux Machine
Apple gives instructions for using Swift on Linux here: https://swift.org/download/#linux

And you can also read this introduction to using Swift on Linux here: http://www.raywenderlich.com/122189/introduction-to-open-source-swift-on-linux

## Installing on a non-OS X, non-Linux Machine
As I use a Mac, I cannot personally try any of the following work-arounds for non-OS X users, but it may be worth looking into further if you really want to code with Swift. **I cannot vouch for their validity. They merely came from a quick Google search to provide a starting point for someone looking for alternative methods to using Swift. Do more research before attempting any of them!**:

- For programmers on Windows machines, check out [Silver] (http://elementscompiler.com/elements/silver/), a Swift IDE.

- You can also look into using a virtual machine. While I think it's against Apple licensing terms to run OS X on non-Apple hardware, you could try Linux. [VirtualBox] (https://www.virtualbox.org/) is popular and open-source.

- For programmers who do not want to/cannot install anything at all, try [RunSwift] (http://www.runswiftlang.com/), a website which allows you to use Swift in the browser. This requires an internet connection and seems only to support Swift 1.2, not the most up-to-date version, Swift 2.
