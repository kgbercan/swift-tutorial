# Installation
Swift is typically installed by downloading the appropriate programming environment; you don't need to download Swift seperately from an IDE. If you would like to use a version of Swift that is in the works (and that possibly has some bugs), you will need to download it from the [Swift.org download page] (https://swift.org/download/#latest-development-snapshots).

You may notice that Swift.org only gives instructions for downloading to OS X and Linux. Apple does not have IDEs for any other operating systems, so if you do not have a Mac or Linux machine, you may not be able to code in Swift.

## Installing on a non-OS X, non-Linux Machine
As I use a Mac, I cannot personally try any of the following work-arounds for non-OS X users, but it may be worth looking into further if you really want to code with Swift. **I cannot vouch for their validity. They merely came from a quick Google search to provide a starting point for someone looking for alternative methods to using Swift. Do more research before attempting any of them!**:

- For programmers on Windows machines, check out [Silver] (http://elementscompiler.com/elements/silver/), a Swift IDE.

- You can also look into using a virtual machine. While I think it's against Apple licensing terms to run OS X on non-Apple hardware, you could try Linux. (VirtualBox) [https://www.virtualbox.org/] is popular and open-source.

- For programmers who do not want to/cannot install anything at all, try [RunSwift] (http://www.runswiftlang.com/), a website which allows you to use Swift in the browser. This requires an internet connection and seems only to support Swift 1.2, not the most up-to-date version, Swift 2.
