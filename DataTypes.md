1. What are the naming requirements for variables in your language? What about naming conventions? Are they enforced by the compiler/interpreter, or are they just standards in the community?
2. Is your language statically or dynamically typed?
3. Strongly typed or weakly typed?
4. If you put this line (or something similar) in a program and try to print x, what does it do? If it
doesn't compile, why? Is there something you can do to make it compile?
x = "5" + 6
5. Describe the limitations (or lack thereof) of your programming language as they relate to the coding portion of the assignment (adding ints and floats, storing different types in lists, etc). Are there other restrictions or pitfalls that the documentation mentions that you need to be aware of?
6. How do type conversions work in your language? Are the conversions narrowing or widening, and do they work by default or do they have to be declared by the programmer?

• int
• string
• floating-point number
• boolean
• array/list
• hash/dictionary

Can you add ints and floats?
If you do, is the resulting variable an int (narrowing conversion) or a float (widening conversion)? Can you put different data types in the same array or list? Can one data type be converted to another (int to float, string to int, etc)?
